## Web UI

The static pages under `web/` run **in the browser only**: **partition** for all modes except Micro strategy choice; **Micro (5-tile)** adds **Bellman (optimal)** vs **partition** using `web/data/optimal_policy_5.bin`. There is no Python web server or `POST /api/step` in this UI.

```bash
# One-shot: partition JSON + Micro policy + esbuild bundle (needs small pools in data/)
make prepare_web_deploy
# Same script: ./scripts/prepare_web_deploy.sh
# After TS-only changes: ./scripts/prepare_web_deploy.sh --web-only

# Manual steps (equivalent to full prepare_web_deploy):
make browser_partition_artifacts
make browser_partition_data_web
cd web && npm install && npm run build
# Full local regen including Maxi manifest from equations_10.txt:
# make browser_partition_data
# Optional: http://127.0.0.1:8123/ — npm run dev
```

- **Artifacts:** `make browser_partition_data_web` writes `web/data/partition/{classic,binerdle,quad}_nN/` (see [docs/PARTITION_BROWSER_ARTIFACTS.md](docs/PARTITION_BROWSER_ARTIFACTS.md)) from tracked `data/equations_{5,6,7,8}.txt`, runs `micro_policy_web` (uses committed `web/data/optimal_policy_5.bin` or copies from `data/optimal_policy_5.bin` after `make micro_policy`). Maxi (`n=10`) is a static manifest only (`56+4-21=39`, pool size 2102375) — no `data/equations_10.txt` required. For a manifest derived from the live Maxi pool file, use `make browser_partition_data` locally.
- **Regression check:** `npm run validate:partition --prefix web` compares the browser partition engine to `./solver_json` (the binary is only used for that test, not by the UI).
- **Strategies (web):** Bellman = precomputed Micro policy; partition = browser partition engine for all lengths/modes.

### Deploying to Vercel (GitHub)

1. **Commit** source and small inputs: `data/equations_{5,6,7,8}.txt`, `web/data/optimal_policy_5.bin`, `web/src/**`, `Makefile`, `src/browser_partition_artifacts.cpp`, `scripts/prepare_web_deploy.sh`, `web/package*.json`, etc. Do **not** commit generated `web/data/partition/**` or `web/app.bundle.js` (they are gitignored; Vercel creates them at build time).
2. In Vercel: **Import** the repo → **Root Directory**: `.` (repository root) → Framework: **Other**. Either rely on [vercel.json](vercel.json) or set manually:
   - **Install Command**: `npm ci --prefix web`
   - **Build Command**: `bash ./scripts/prepare_web_deploy.sh`
   - **Output Directory**: `web`
3. The build image must provide **`g++` with OpenMP** (`-fopenmp`) for `browser_partition_artifacts`. If a Vercel image ever lacks it, use a **custom build image** or move artifact generation to GitHub Actions and deploy the prebuilt `web/` output.
4. Node **18+** matches `engines` in `web/package.json`.

## Detailed usage

### 1. Generate equations

**By default**, standalone 0 on the left-hand side is excluded (official Nerdle rules).

```bash
./generate --len 5
./generate --len 6
./generate --len 7
./generate --len 8
```

**Micro Bellman policy** (`nerdle_micro`, `nerdle --len 5`, `bench_nerdle`): after generating `data/equations_5.txt`, build the lookup table used for exact min-expected-guess play:

```bash
make micro_policy
```

Why Bellman, how ties are broken, and how this differs from the six-try-aware partition policy: **[docs/MICRO_STRATEGY.md](docs/MICRO_STRATEGY.md)**.

Use **`--strategy bellman`** (default for Micro when the file exists), **`--strategy entropy`** for the v2 selector, or **`--strategy partition`**: among remaining candidate equations, maximize the number of distinct feedback patterns on **S**; among ties, maximize **P(solve within the tries left)** (uniform prior on **S**), then minimize **E[guesses]** under the same partition policy (computed recursively). Smallest index last. For pools larger than 128 equations, only the partition + index rule is used (no DP).

**Options:**
- `--len N` — Equation length, 5-8 (default: 8)
- `--allow-bare` — Include bare LHS (e.g. `18=18`); default: LHS must have ≥1 operator
- `--allow-standalone-zero` — Include equations with standalone 0 on LHS
- `--no-zero` — Exclude equations where the result is 0

**Maxi (10 tiles):**
```bash
./generate_maxi --no-pointless-brackets   # ~1.81M, exclude brackets that don't change eval
./generate_maxi                     # ~1.86M, include all (some redundant bracket variants)
```
Pointless brackets = removal yields same result (e.g. `(2)`, `(a+b)+c`). Necessary ones like `3*(9+4)=39` are kept.

**Solve and benchmark Maxi:**
```bash
./solve data/equations_10.txt            # optimal first guess (may take a while)
./bench_nerdle data/equations_10.txt     # 6 tries, uses first eq as guess until solve is run
```

---

### 2. Optimal first guess (`solve`)

```bash
./solve data/equations_5.txt
./solve data/equations_8.txt
```

Finds the entropy-optimal first guess. Uses OpenMP for parallel computation.

---

### 3. Interactive Nerdle (`nerdle`)

Solver-assisted play for single-equation Nerdle. Play on [nerdlegame.com](https://www.nerdlegame.com/); enter your guess and the feedback (G/P/B) you received; the tool suggests the next guess.

```bash
./nerdle --len 5     # micro
./nerdle --len 6     # mini
./nerdle --len 7     # midi
./nerdle --len 8     # classic
./nerdle --len 10    # maxi (²³ brackets)
./nerdle --len 5 --strategy partition   # greedy max-feedback-partition (any length)
```

Press Enter to use the suggested guess, or type your own. Type `y` when you solve it. Requires `data/equations_N.txt` (run `./generate --len N` or `./generate_maxi` first).

---

### 4. Binerdle (`binerdle`)

Guess 2 Nerdle equations in 7 tries. **One guess per turn** applies to both; you get separate feedback for each equation. The two equations are always distinct. Uses stratified sampling when the candidate pair space is large.

```bash
./binerdle --len 6     # mini (6-tile equations)
./binerdle --len 8     # normal (8-tile equations)
./binerdle --len 8 --strategy partition
```

Enter feedback for each equation (G/P/B or `y` if correct). You can override the suggested guess by typing your own (same length); press Enter to use the suggestion. `--strategy partition` chooses from the union of the two remaining candidate sets and maximizes the chance of solving one board now and the other on the next guess; ties use canonical equation order.

---

### 5. Quad Nerdle (`quadnerdle`)

Guess 4 Nerdle equations in 10 tries. **One guess per turn** applies to all four; you get separate feedback for each equation. All 4 equations are always distinct. Uses stratified Monte Carlo for entropy when the candidate space is large.

```bash
./quadnerdle --len 8
```

Enter feedback for each of the 4 equations (G/P/B or `y` if correct). Recommended first guess: **1\*15-9=6** (Quad-optimal) or **43-27=16** (Binerdle optimal). Run `./solve_quadnerdle data/equations_8.txt` to recompute.

---

### 6. Benchmark (`bench_nerdle`)

```bash
./bench_nerdle data/equations_8.txt
./bench_nerdle data/equations_8.txt --selector v2   # default is v2
./bench_nerdle data/equations_10.txt --sample 5000   # Maxi: sample 5k (full ~1.8M takes hours)
./bench_nerdle data/equations_8.txt --selector v1    # legacy: 300-guess pool, 1-ply entropy only
./bench_nerdle data/equations_5.txt --strategy partition
```

Simulates the solver against all equations and reports mean/max guesses and distribution. **`--strategy`**: Micro defaults to **Bellman** when `data/optimal_policy_5.bin` exists; otherwise **entropy** with **`--selector v2`** (default): full guess pool (or candidate ∪ random sample for Maxi-sized sets), 1-ply entropy plus a small bonus when the guess is still a candidate, then a 2-ply tiebreak on the top finalists. **`v1`** reproduces the older subsampled-pool benchmark for comparison. **`--strategy partition`** uses the rule above (recursive P / EV tie-breaks when the equation pool has ≤128 entries).

---

### 7. Binerdle benchmark (`bench_binerdle`)

```bash
./bench_binerdle data/equations_6.txt   # mini, exhaustive n×n pairs
./bench_binerdle data/equations_8.txt   # normal, exhaustive n×n pairs
./bench_binerdle --strategy partition data/equations_6.txt
./bench_binerdle --strategy partition --sample 100000 --seed 42 data/equations_6.txt   # Monte Carlo
```

Simulates Binerdle with one shared guess per turn. Reports mean guesses and distribution. Turns = when both candidate sets are reduced to one equation each (same stopping rule as the benchmark loop). By default it runs **all** ordered pairs (i,j), including i=j; use **`--sample K`** for **K** Monte Carlo samples (uniform random i and j in `[0,n)` with replacement) and **`--seed S`** for a fixed RNG seed (default 42 when seed unset and sample mode is used).

**Partition strategy — Monte Carlo guess-count distribution** (representative; regenerate after changing `data/equations_*.txt`):

| Pool | Samples | Seed | Mean turns | Distribution (turns: count, %) | Fail 8+ |
|------|--------|------|------------|--------------------------------|---------|
| Mini 6 `data/equations_6.txt` (206 eq) | 100000 | 42 | 2.832 | 1:1509 (1.5%) · 2:38860 (38.9%) · 3:34910 (34.9%) · 4:24331 (24.3%) · 5:390 (0.4%) | 0 |
| Normal 8 `data/equations_8.txt` (~17.7k eq) | 15000 | 42 | 3.544 | 1:3 (0.0%) · 2:2285 (15.2%) · 3:4242 (28.3%) · 4:6676 (44.5%) · 5:1643 (11.0%) · 6:121 (0.8%) · 7:28 (0.2%) | 2 (0.01%) |

Commands used for the table:

```text
./bench_binerdle --strategy partition --sample 100000 --seed 42 data/equations_6.txt
./bench_binerdle --strategy partition --sample 15000  --seed 42 data/equations_8.txt
```

The Normal 8 run uses fewer samples because each pair is more expensive; the two failures in 15k samples are rare events (Monte Carlo noise around a small true failure rate).

---

### 8. Quad Nerdle benchmark (`bench_quadnerdle`)

```bash
./bench_quadnerdle data/equations_8.txt
./bench_quadnerdle data/equations_8.txt --sample 10000
./bench_quadnerdle data/equations_8.txt --single    # use 48-32=16 as first guess
./bench_quadnerdle data/equations_8.txt --binerdle  # use 43-27=16 as first guess
```

Simulates Quad Nerdle over **sampled distinct** quadruples (all 4 equations different). Default 5000 samples. Compare single vs Binerdle first guess with `--single` / `--binerdle`.

---

## Nerdle rules (summary)

- Each guess is a valid arithmetic equation
- Characters: `0-9`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`
- Exactly one `=`, with only a number to the right
- Standard order of operations (* and / before + and -)
- LHS must have at least one operator (no bare numbers like `18=18`)
- No standalone 0 on the LHS (0 may appear in 10, 20, etc., or on the RHS)
- Feedback: **G** = correct char, correct position; **P** = correct char, wrong position; **B** = char not in solution

---

## Dependencies

- **C++ compiler with OpenMP** — e.g. `g++` with `-fopenmp`
- **Node.js** (optional) — `cd web && npm install` to build the browser bundle (`esbuild`)

---

## Build

```bash
make              # build all tools
make clean        # remove binaries
```

## Optimal first guesses (precomputed)

**Nerdle (single):**

| Length | First guess | Entropy |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| 5 (micro) | 3+2=5 | Precomputed Bellman policy (`data/optimal_policy_5.bin`; see `make micro_policy`) |
| 6 (mini) | 4*7=28 | 5.82 bits |
| 7 (midi) | 4+27=31 | ~8.26 bits |
| 8 (classic) | 48-32=16 | 9.78 bits |
| 10 (maxi) | 56+4-21=39 | 1-ply entropy: run `./solve data/equations_10.txt` (bits depend on the generated pool) |

**Binerdle (pair space, distinct equations):**

| Length | First guess | Notes |
|--------|-------------|------|
| 6 (mini) | 4*7=28 | Same as single |
| 8 (normal) | 43-27=16 | Slightly better than 48-32=16 for distinct pairs |

**Quad Nerdle (quad space, len 8):**

| First guess | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| 1\*15-9=6 | Quad-optimal (stratified MC) |
| 43-27=16 | Binerdle optimal; very close |
| 48-32=16 | Single Nerdle optimal; very close |

Run `./solve_quadnerdle data/equations_8.txt` to recompute. **All 4 equations are always distinct** (space = P(n,4) = n×(n-1)×(n-2)×(n-3), not n⁴). Uses **adaptive strategy** with stratified sampling and a 200k-quad tiebreaker when the top 2 are within 0.02 bits. Use `--no-stratify` for plain random sampling.

**Benchmark stats (lengths 5–10, entropy v2 / Bellman):** `bench_nerdle` uses **precomputed Bellman** for Micro (len 5) when `data/optimal_policy_5.bin` is present; other lengths use **v2** (full equation pool + 2-ply; see `src/nerdle_core.hpp`).

| Length | EV guesses | 2 guesses | 3 guesses | 4 guesses | 5 guesses |
|--------|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 5 (micro) | 2.94 | 23.6% | 57.5% | 16.5% | 1.6% |
| 6 (mini) | 2.64 | 35.4% | 63.6% | 0.5% | 0% |
| 7 (midi) | 3.08 | 6.1% | 79.6% | 14.3% | 0% |
| 8 (classic) | 3.03 | 7.6% | 81.4% | 11.0% | 0.006% |
| 10 (maxi) | ~3.43 | — | — | — | — |

*Rows 5–8: full equation lists. Maxi: 500-equation random sample (`--selector v2`; sampling uses `--sample` with fixed shuffle seed 42). A 5k-sample v1 run on Maxi was ~3.65 EV; v2 is slower on Maxi—use `--sample`.*

**Partition policy** (greedy max distinct feedbacks; with `tie_depth` ≥ 1, refine ties by recursive “solve in 1, 2, …” comparison — the same engine as `./partition_report`). The table is the **exact aggregate** from `./partition_report --pool data/equations_N.txt --tie-depth 6` (full pools; root model and exact sections match). `tie_depth=6` is high enough in practice for strong tie resolution on these pools. The **first guess** column is the policy pick at the root (not necessarily the entropy-optimal row in the `solve` table above).

| Length | First guess (partition) | Mean guesses | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | fail in 6 |
|--------|------------------------|-------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 (micro) | 3+2=5 | 2.961 | 1 | 31 | 74 | 15 | 5 | 1 | 0 |
| 6 (mini) | 4*7=28 | 2.641 | 1 | 74 | 129 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 7 (midi) | 6+25=31 | 3.138 | 1 | 611 | 4756 | 1107 | 140 | 38 | 8 |
| 8 (classic) | 52-34=18 | 3.048 | 1 | 1702 | 13544 | 2410 | 60 | 6 | 0 |
| 10 (maxi) | 56+4-21=39† | 3.447 | 1 | 25028 | 1160996 | 870997 | 42190 | 2747 | 416 |

*Columns 1–6: number of equations solved in exactly that many guesses; **fail in 6**: not solved within six tries (bucket 7 in tool output).*

*†Maxi: exact aggregate for the **~2.1M** pool is computed with a **fixed root opening** (same first guess as the partition policy, `--opening`); the tool skips building a full root n×n feedback matrix, buckets secrets by the opening’s feedback, then runs per-bucket subproblems. Progress on stderr estimates wall time. Example (representative; pool size **2102375**):*

```text
  [progress] fixed-opening buckets: 24750/25029  elapsed_s=33.89  rate_buckets/s=730.2  eta_s(rough)=0.382
  [progress] fixed-opening buckets: 24875/25029  elapsed_s=34.01  rate_buckets/s=731.5  eta_s(rough)=0.211
  [progress] fixed-opening buckets: 25000/25029  elapsed_s=34.17  rate_buckets/s=731.6  eta_s(rough)=0.0396
  [progress] fixed-opening buckets: 25029/25029  elapsed_s=34.32  rate_buckets/s=729.3  eta_s(rough)=0

--- Exact aggregate over all 2102375 secrets (same policy; no sampling) ---
First guess in walk: 56+4-21=39  (root from --opening)
Mean total guesses: 3.447233248
Exact distribution: 1:1 2:25028 3:1160996 4:870997 5:42190 6:2747 7:416
  (bucket 7 = not solved in 6): 416
Exact-aggregate wall time: 34.57156782 s
```

```bash
./partition_report --pool data/equations_10.txt --tie-depth 6 --opening '56+4-21=39'
```

*Use `./bench_partition_aggregate` for the same binary and flags as `partition_report` (e.g. `--progress` for long runs). For very large pools, `--no-exact-aggregate` prints only the root model (EV, rounded distribution) without walking the full tree. If RAM is tight on Maxi, `--no-child-tables` skips per-bucket n×n feedback tables (slower, less memory).*

**Maxi — unique‑symbol cascade (record).** A separate, heavy search (`cascade_9_to_4` style: restrict legal first guesses to equations that use at most **K** distinct tile symbols, then take the one with the largest **partition count** — distinct feedbacks vs the full Maxi pool). Off‑cloud batch output saved here so the numbers are not re-derived later:

| K (max distinct symbols) | max_partitions | Equation |
|---------------------------|---------------|----------|
| 4 | 5478 | `25+5+22=52` |
| 5 | 9161 | `22+1+21=44` |
| 6 | 12321 | `244-211=33` |
| 7 | 15593 | `42+2-11=33` |
| 8 | 18557 | `46+2-12=36` |
| 9 | 21678 | `48+2-14=36` |

The **K = 10** (full symbol diversity) winner matches the max‑partition first guess from this repository — `kMaxiPartitionFixedOpening` in `src/partition_greedy.hpp` (`56+4-21=39`) and `./partition_report --pool data/equations_10.txt --tie-depth 6` on the generated pool. So the cascade and the in‑repo partition policy agree at the top level; the table above is the intermediate rungs (K = 4 … 9) only.

## Why different games favour different first guesses

**Single Nerdle** maximizes H(fb) — how evenly the guess partitions the solution space. A guess like `48-32=16` is optimal because it creates many distinct feedback patterns with similar probability.

**Binerdle** maximizes H(fb₁, fb₂) over *pairs* of equations. This equals H(fb₁) + H(fb₂|fb₁). A guess that’s good for single might induce correlated feedback when applied to two equations (similar equations → similar feedback). `43-27=16` is slightly better than `48-32=16` for pairs because it tends to produce more *independent* feedback across the two slots — knowing fb₁ gives less information about fb₂.

**Quad Nerdle** maximizes H(fb₁, fb₂, fb₃, fb₄). We want each successive conditional entropy H(fbₖ|fb₁…fbₖ₋₁) to stay high. A guess that “spreads out” feedback across equations with different structure (operators, digits, result size) is better for Quad: it reduces correlation between the four patterns. A guess optimal for single might cluster too much feedback into a few joint patterns when applied to four diverse equations.

---

## Stratified sampling

Plain Monte Carlo can undersample certain equation families (e.g. division-heavy or small-result equations). **Stratified sampling** classifies each equation by type (operator mix + result magnitude bucket) and samples proportionally from each stratum. This yields lower variance and a more stable ranking of guesses. Used in:

- **solve_quadnerdle** — for finding the optimal first guess (use `--no-stratify` to disable)
- **quadnerdle** — for subsequent guesses when the candidate space exceeds 50k
- **binerdle** — for subsequent guesses when the pair space exceeds 50k

Implementation uses 16 strata and proportional allocation.

---

## Hardest equations (most guesses to solve)

None require 6 guesses; these take the maximum (5 for len 5/7/8/10, 4 for len 6):

| Length | Max guesses | Equations |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 5 (micro) | 5 | `1*5=5`, `5/5=1`, `9*1=9`, `9/1=9` |
| 6 (mini) | 4 | `12-9=3` |
